# 2048 game

2048 is a simple yet addictive sliding puzzle game recreated in JavaScript. The goal is to combine numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid until you reach the 2048 tile. The player slide tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right) and matching tiles merge into one, doubling their value. The game ends when there are no more possible moves.
